## Introduction

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) combines the strengths of information retrieval and natural language generation. By retrieving relevant documents from a knowledge base and using them as context, RAG models can produce more accurate and contextually relevant responses. This project provides a basic setup to explore RAG using GPT-4 embeddings.

## Features

- **GPT-4 Embeddings**: Utilizes GPT-4 for generating embeddings, ensuring high-quality semantic representations.
- **Document Ingestion**: Processes and indexes documents for efficient retrieval.
- **Query Handling**: Accepts user queries and retrieves pertinent documents to augment generation.
- **Sample Outputs**: Includes examples of query responses to illustrate functionality.

## Installation

To set up the project locally:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SindhuraSriram/RAG-basic-gpt4-embedding.git
   cd RAG-basic-gpt4-embedding
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:

   Ensure you have Python 3.7 or higher. Then, install the required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**:

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add necessary configurations, such as API keys and model paths.

## Usage

Follow these steps to run the project:

1. **Ingest Documents**:

   Use the `ingest.py` script to process and index your documents:

   ```bash
   python ingest.py
   ```

2. **Run the Application**:

   Start the application using:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

3. **Submit Queries**:

   With the application running, you can submit queries to retrieve and generate augmented responses.
